# 2048_duel
A 2-player 2048 game. Finally!

## About
This project is a 2-player adaptation of the popular 2048 game created by Gabriele Cirulli. It is completely free and available to play [here](www.2048duel.com)!

## Credit
I copied some CSS elements, namely the grid layout and animation styles, from the original 2048 source code avalable [here](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048), but everything else was done independently so that I could learn frontend development. 

I'd love to thank Matthew Bullock, Sofia Cortes, and Timmy Kurtin for style ideas and playtesting. I hope you enjoy!
